This is the final version of the Windows-based code from my E4618. Must be run on VS Enterprise 2019. This repos has all of the bulky files removed from the original template, so it won't work.

The Raspi stuff will be added later once i get GitHub working on my Pi.

Files "lab1" and "lab2" can be run on any PC. 
Labs 3-6 are complex, requiring a micro controller.
labs 7 and 8 are on my Pi.
lab 9, has the 4618_Client.cpp set-up on this end, but the pi end isn't here.
